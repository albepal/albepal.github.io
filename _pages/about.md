Welcome! I am a **PhD candidate** at the European Centre for Advanced Research in Economics and Statistics (<a href="https://ecares.ulb.be/">ECARES</a>) at the <a href="https://www.ulb.be/">Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles</a>. Previously, I was a **Research Economist** for the <a href="https://www.nbb.be/en">National Bank of Belgium</a> between October 2023 and September 2025.

My main research interests are International Trade and Production Networks.
